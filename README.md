Data Analytics Project
Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics process, covering data loading, exploration, cleaning, SQL analysis, dashboard development, and reporting. The objective is to transform raw data into meaningful insights using industry-standard tools and practices.

Dataset

Format: CSV

Type: Structured dataset

The dataset contains real-world data with missing values and inconsistencies

Used for analysis, querying, and visualization throughout the project

Tools and Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server)

Power BI

Jupyter Notebook

Gamma (for presentation)

Git and GitHub

Project Steps
1. Data Loading

Loaded the dataset into Python using Pandas

Reviewed structure, data types, and basic statistics

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distributions and trends

Identified missing values and outliers

Generated summary statistics and visual insights

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing and inconsistent values

Removed duplicates

Converted data types where required

Standardized column names

4. SQL Analysis

Loaded cleaned data into a relational database

Wrote SQL queries to:

Filter and aggregate data

Perform joins

Answer business-focused questions

Queries are compatible with PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server

5. Dashboard Development

Connected Power BI to the database

Built an interactive dashboard with key metrics and trends

Applied filters and slicers for analysis

6. Reporting and Presentation

Created a written report summarizing findings

Developed a presentation using Gamma to communicate insights clearly

Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard highlights key performance metrics, trends, and comparisons, allowing users to explore the data interactively.

Results

Identified important trends and patterns in the data

Provided data-driven insights for decision-making

Demonstrated the full analytics lifecycle from raw data to final presentation
